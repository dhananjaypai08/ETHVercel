## Overview
ETHVercel is a revolutionary decentralized deployment platform that combines privacy-preserving deployment mechanisms with tokenized deployment credentials and cross-chain attestations. By leveraging zero-knowledge proofs for access control and implementing a novel staking mechanism through sUSDE, ETHVercel creates a secure, incentivized ecosystem for decentralized application deployment.
